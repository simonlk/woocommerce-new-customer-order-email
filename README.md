WooCommerce New Customer Order Email
=================================

Plugin to send a single email to the customer when the order is placed, just like the "New Order" email that is sent to the store admin.

The purpose of this plugin is to replace the Order Processing and Order Complete emails that are send to customers. It's useful for stores that only want to send one email to their customers when the order is placed and do not need to send another email to the customer when the order is shipped.

To avoid sending duplicate emails to your customers, when you activate this plugin be sure to disable the Order Processing and Order Complete emails within WooCommerce settings.
